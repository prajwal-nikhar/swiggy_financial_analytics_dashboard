### Key DAX Formulas

```dax
// Revenue Growth Calculation
Revenue_Growth_Pct = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total_Revenue] - CALCULATE([Total_Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])),
    CALCULATE([Total_Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])),
    0
)

// Variance Flagging System
Variance_Flag = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    [Revenue_Variance_Pct] > 0.1, "üü¢ Favorable",
    [Revenue_Variance_Pct] < -0.1, "üî¥ Unfavorable", 
    "üü° Within Range"
)

// Financial Health Scoring
Profitability_Score = 
VAR GrossScore = IF([Gross_Margin_Pct] >= 0.4, 25, [Gross_Margin_Pct] * 62.5)
VAR EBITDAScore = IF([EBITDA_Margin_Pct] >= 0.15, 25, [EBITDA_Margin_Pct] * 166.67)
VAR NetScore = IF([Net_Income] > 0, 25, 0)
VAR GrowthScore = IF([Revenue_Growth_Pct] >= 0.1, 25, [Revenue_Growth_Pct] * 250)
RETURN (GrossScore + EBITDAScore + NetScore + GrowthScore)
```
